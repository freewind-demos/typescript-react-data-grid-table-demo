TypeScript React Data Grid Table Demo
=================================

Define a wrapper component for @tanstack/react-table

Issue: can't define the correct type so I have to use `as any` to pass a table instance

Fixed: I imported wrong types and fixed in newer commits, thanks to @Sizuo.Liu

```
npm install
npm run demo
```

It will open page on browser automatically.
